# Seq2seq stock prediction

## this project is a fucking joke
how can you have a project like this for university students when the fundamental source is not reliable? Or the author's credibility is absent?

Prof. Zhang is a joke; maybe he just can't program his own algorithm or design his own homework for deep learning.

## run
run ```seq2seq.py``` like ```python seq2seq.py```

### this is still in active development, so... don't expect anything reliable.

All the changes will be made in ```seq2seq.py```, and ```prediction_game.py``` is not in use anymore.
